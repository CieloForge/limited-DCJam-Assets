# General rules

[Copy from DCJam](<https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2024>), with the following (minor) changes:

**Goal**: Using limited assets, create a finished and reasonably polished dungeon crawler; not a prototype, proof of concept or tech demo, but a small game you can play from beginning to end.

**FAQ**: No to 3rd party assets (Gen AI or pre-made other than as provided)

**Rating**: Entries will be rated in multiple categories (TODO: draft these later, if we agree we want multiple, but I'll throw out the controversial set of "Overall Fun", "Innovation", "Retrocity", "Asset Utilization")

**Recommendations**: Add default of Q/E for strafe

# Limited Assets Rules
* Limit yourself to only using the game assets provided
* **Graphics**
  * You may additionally use, plus up to 10 original, hand-made (no Gen-AI), "bonus" tiles in the same style - 12x12, limited palette.  Bonus tiles must be shared on the itch game page (maybe: and may be included by the jam organizers in a post-jam asset pack release?)
  * The assets may be palette swapped, stretched, scaled, used as textures on 2D/3D primitives (quads/cubes/spheres/cylinders/particles/etc), but all textures must be recognizably from the asset pack (or your bonus tiles) (TODO: provide examples)
  * "Palette swapping" means that every texel which was the same color in the original image should all be swapped to the same (new) color (including transparent) (TODO: provide examples)
  * Cropping tiles to extract recognizable elements (e.g. just the door from a door + frame tile, or a lever from one tile to place in front of a different background) is allowed, as long as the result is still identifiable (TODO: provide examples)
  * Tiles do not necessarily need to be used 1:1 for wall textures (e.g. you may texture a wall with a 3x3 grid of tiles, as long as the originals are still identifiable)
  * It is not allowed to use models, textures, fonts or other assets that come with your game engine (with the exception of primitives as noted above)
  * Example against the spirit of the jam: any overlaying or compositing where the result is essentially a completely new texture that could more simply have been authored
* Fonts may be styled (drop-shadows, outlines, etc) as long as they remain recognizable
* Custom materials, shaders, post-processing, etc, are all allowed, as long as all textures are sourced from the assets (examples: dithered lighting, outlining)
* **Audio**
  * (TODO: insert line about what's allowed to be done with the provided SFX/music)
  * Original voice recordings are allowed (TODO: insert recommended sampling rate/settings to match style)
* If you feel unclear on whether something is allowed or not, feel free to reach out on Discord.  It's meant to be a game jam where you challenge yourself to only use premade assets.
