# Updated DCJAM 2025 rules

Rules from the [DCJAM 2025](https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2025) itch.io page, with irrelevant rules stripped out.

Temporary placeholders are preceeded with (DRAFT), for rules we will need to add at a minimum, other modifications **in bold**.

We must carefully consider if we wish to reword / change any of these rules, and shouldn't blinding assume the existing DCJAM rules are right for this jam.

## Goal
**Using limited assets,** create a finished and reasonably polished dungeon crawler; not a prototype, proof of concept or tech demo, but a small game you can play from beginning to end.

## Rules

- The game must have first-person exploration at all times. (See the above GIF). Exceptions are point to point overworld map movement (fast travel), combat screens, cut scenes, town screen, inventory screen other relevant screens.
- The game must have explorable locations. It doesn't have to be a dungeon in the traditional sense. It can be urban environments, outdoors, spaceship interiors, planetary surfaces etc. (depending on the jam theme). Whichever environment the game has it must be viewed and explored in first-person. 
- The game must feature step movement on a square grid (no hexagons, octagons, etc.). Smooth transitions between grid squares are allowed. Half-steps or dividing a logical grid square into smaller squares are NOT accepted. The size of a square should equal the size of the wall segments it is connected to. Consider a grid square as a cube with a ground, four walls, and a ceiling. **If there are visible enemies, they** must also move on the same grid as the player.
- The game must feature 90-degree turns in the four cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. Smooth transitions between 90-degree angles are allowed. Turning must be invoked by keyboard (or gamepad) control. Mouse-look is permitted as a temporary way to look around, but it should snap to 90 degrees when not in use. Games that allow 90-degree turns up and down are also acceptable.
- The game must have a player controlled character (or party of characters), or the abstraction of a character or persona.
- The game must at the very least have some basic stats. (Minimum a single health/power bar)
- The game must have a win condition.
- The game must have a death/perish/fail condition, or some other end-of-game mechanic. Roguelite mechanics where you restart game upon death but retain some progress is allowed.
- The game must have at least one way to affect character stat(s). Examples are resting, potions, items with bonuses, food, water, powerups etc.
- The game must have combat or a similar mechanic for determining outcome of certain situations, enemy encounters and events.

- **(DRAFT) The game must include a clearly visible interpretation of the theme. Entries without a clear and visible interpretation of the theme will be disqualified.**
    - **Will we have a theme? If so, 1 or multiple to choose from?**

- Your game must not contain nudity, hateful language or visuals. Please consider avoiding extremely strong language and excessive gore, as the games in this jam should be suitable for a general audience. Failure to do so may result in disqualification.


## FAQ

- **(DRAFT) Will there be a theme? Yes, there will be X themes. They will be announced right before the jam starts.**
    - **TBD**

- What game engine can I use? You may use any game engine like Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, Love2D etc.
- Can I use my own game engine? Yes, you may use your own home-brew game engine.
- Can I re-use any old source code? You may re-use helper libraries and classes that makes little sense to write again from scratch.
- Can I start working on the game before the jam starts? No. The game must be a new game project started and finished within the jam time frame, not just another week of work on an existing one.
- Can I put a price tag on my game? The game must be free to download and play to the end. A commercial version of the game may of course be released after the jam ends, perhaps with added content and features.
- Can I use **AI generated content or pre-made assets or asset packs**? **No, you must use the provided limited assets, and any bonus assets made for the jam must be made by the jam participants.**


## Rating

- TBD

## Recommendations

- Copy from [DCJam](<https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2025>) but add default of Q/E for strafe

## Prizes

- TBD - likely nil, perhaps discord role, perhaps not - should probably depend on participation volume (would be good to keep that role somewhat rare and exclusive)
